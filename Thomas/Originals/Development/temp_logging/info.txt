Hi Thomas,

Please find attached zip file which contains the MATLAB files used for temperature logging.

The file ‘getsingletemp’ is used to communicate with the Pico Technology TC-08 thermocouple data logger. It assumes a type K thermocouple plugged into channel 1. It requires the 2 files located in the ‘win64’ folder.

To solve the problem of MATLAB running out of memory I had to modify ‘capture.m’ so it doesn’t open the PicoScope each time a measurement is made. Instead, ‘open_scope’ is run first which creates a global device object.  ‘capture.m’ then makes use of the device object to communicate with the PicoScope.

Best regards,
Andy
